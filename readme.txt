1. Real-time Inventory Tracking: Develop a real-time inventory tracking system that monitors stock levels, detects low stock or out-of-stock items, 
and sends automated alerts to the shop manager. This feature helps in efficient inventory replenishment and reduces the risk of stockouts.

2. Sales and Purchase Management: Integrate modules for sales and purchase management, enabling users to record and track sales transactions, generate invoices,
and manage supplier orders. The system should automatically update inventory levels based on sales and purchases, providing accurate stock information.

3. Analytics and Reporting: Implement data analytics capabilities to provide insightful reports on various inventory metrics such as stock turnover, profit margins,
and popular products. This information helps managers make informed decisions regarding inventory optimization and sales strategies.

4. Supplier and Customer Management: Develop a module to manage supplier information, including contact details, pricing agreements, and delivery schedules.
Additionally, incorporate customer management features to maintain a database of customer details, purchase history, and preferences.

5. User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and efficient inventory management.
Consider implementing features such as search filters, sorting options, and customizable dashboards to cater to different user preferences.
